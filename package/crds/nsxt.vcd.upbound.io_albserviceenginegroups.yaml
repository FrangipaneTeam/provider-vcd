        description: ALBServiceEngineGroup is the Schema for the ALBServiceEngineGroups
          API. Provides a resource to manage NSX-T ALB Service Engine Groups. A Service
          Engine Group is an isolation domain that also defines shared service engine
          properties, such as size, network access, and failover. Resources in a service
          engine group can be used for different virtual services, depending on your
          tenant needs. These resources cannot be shared between different service
          engine groups.
